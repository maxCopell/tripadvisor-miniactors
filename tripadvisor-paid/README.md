## What can this unofficial Tripadvisor API do?
This scraper lets you get data from Tripadvisor fast and easily. It's suitable for such use cases as scraping Tripadvisor reviews, emails, addresses, awards, and many more attributes of hotels and restaurants on the Tripadvisor platform.

This version brings you unlimited number of results and possibility to get all reviews for each place. If you dont need that many results, try our [Free Tripadvisor scraper](https://apify.com/maxcopell/free-tripadvisor) which will give you 100 results per search (and 20 reviews for each place).   

You can either enter the location and download the data from the dataset or send a synchronous request to the actor endpoint and crawl all the information about a single place (e.g., hotel, restaurant) in 15 seconds.

## How do I use Tripadvisor Scraper?
You can either use search term (location), or use specific ids (place, restaurant, or hotel id)

If you use  _search_, you can state how many items you want to get in the  _maximum items_  field, then what content you want to get (attractions, restaurants, hotels). If you are scraping hotels you can also choose check-in dates).

Alternatively, you can scrape review tags from specified places as well as reviews from specific dates (you can set a limit on the number of reviews you want to scrape). You can also select languages and currencies.

## How much does Tripadvisor Scraper cost?
It will cost you approx. USD 0.50 to scrape 1,000 items. The more results you want to scrape, the more time it will take and the more usage credits it will cost.

Apify provides you with USD 5 free usage credits to use every month on the Apify Free plan so you can get up to 10,000 reviews from Tripadvisor Scraper for those credits. So 10k results will be completely free!

But if you need to get more data or to get your data regularly you should grab an Apify subscription. We recommend our $49/month Personal plan - you could get up to 100,000 Tripadvisor reviews every month with the $49 monthly plan!
